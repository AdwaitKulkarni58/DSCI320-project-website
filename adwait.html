              The visualizations below explore the performance of countries in
              the Summer and Winter Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016. The data is
              visualized using heatmaps, faceted bar charts, and line chart
              matrices to analyze the dominance of countries in different events
              over time. The visualizations are interactive and allow users to
              explore the data by selecting specific countries, years, and
              seasons. Following are the research questions supported by the

              The visualizations above support the following tasks by employing
              interactive heatmaps with linked detail brush charts, faceted bar
              charts, and line charts that dynamically adapt based on user

              <h2>Visualization Design Justification</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Heatmap and Detail Brush Chart (Bidirectional Link)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark type used is a point to
                represent each country's performance in a specific year in the
                heatmap. In the brush chart, the mark type used is a segment to
                represent the medal counts won by a country in a specific year.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong> For the heatmap, the horizontal
                position and order channel denotes years starting from 1896 to
                2016, while the vertical position channel represents a country
                (NOC). The saturation channel represents the number of medals
                won by the country in each year and this is a magnitude ordered
                channel as the number of medals is a numerical attribute. The
                color scheme used is sequential as the number of medals
                increases from a minimum to a maximum. Each cell in the heatmap
                has shared boundaries in terms of years and countries,
                horizontally and vertically respectively.<br />
                For the brush chart, the horizontal position and order channels
                represent the year and the vertical position and order channels
                represent the number of medals won by a country. The color hue
                channel represents the type of season (Summer or Winter).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> In the heatmap,
                the sequential color scheme is used to encode magnitude of the
                number of medals won by a country in each year, helping users
                identify regions of high or low medal counts at a glance. The
                position channel for years helps the users read the graph from
                left to right with the years increasing from 1896 to 2016. The
                saturation channel and position channel are magnitude-ordered
                channels and adhere to the principle of effectiveness.
                <br />
                In the brush chart, the 2 colors (orange and blue) on the
                opposite ends of the color hue channel help the users identify
                the Summer and Winter seasons clearly without getting mixed up.
                The years are ordered from left to right in an increasing order
                enabling left to right reading and the number of medals are
                ordered from top to bottom in an increasing order enabling top
                to bottom reading.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> The heatmap is bidirectionally
                linked to the detailed brush chart view below it. Clicking on a
                cell in the heatmap will highlight the corresponding country in
                the heatmap and the corresponding country in the detailed brush
                chart view. Similarly, clicking on a bar in the brush chart will
                highlight the corresponding country in the heatmap. When you
                select a cell in the heatmap or a bar in the brush chart,
                everything else in both the charts will be unhighlighted, and
                clicking anywhere other than the highlighted parts will remove
                the highlight. This selection is preserved when you switch
                between seasons. Users can select a season to display the trends
                for Summer or Winter in both the charts using radio buttons.
                Users can also decide if they want to filter out countries based
                on how many medals they have won (low, medium, high) using a
                dropdown. The heatmap has a brush selection built in so
                rectangular regions can be selected and by moving this selection
                box around with clicking and dragging, you can view updates in
                the detailed brush chart. For both the heatmap and brush chart,
                there is a tooltip on hovering over a cell to show the number of
                medals won by the country in the selected season for the
                corresponding year.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Critique:</strong> There is a lot of information being
                displayed in the heatmap, so users may not be able to completely
                understand the data at a glance. Users may also not be able to
                compare the performance of different countries in different
                seasons as the heatmap only shows the performance of a country
                in a specific season and you have to use the radio buttons to
                switch between seasons, so you might have to manually remember
                the trends of the previous season. Due to the sequential color
                scheme, users might not be able to identify the magnitude of the
                number of medals won by a country in each year without hovering
                over cells. In the brush chart, it is hard to select a country
                as multiple countries are stacked on top of each other in the
                same bar. and can face difficulty in distinguihsing between
                similarly colored cells.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Faceted Bar Chart</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark type used is a segment (bar) to
                represent the medal counts won by a country in a specific year.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong> The horizontal position and order
                channel denotes medal counts starting from the minimum to the
                maximum, while the vertical position channel represents a
                country (NOC). The length of the bars represents the number of
                medals won by the country in a specific year.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> The position
                channel on a common scale follows Weber's Law which states that
                human beings are more likely to compare objects on a common
                scale than on unaligned scales. It is easy to compare between 2
                countries because the length of the bars is proportional to the
                number of medals won by a country in a specific year.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> There is a year dropdown menu to
                select a specific year to display the medal counts won by all
                country in that year. You can also select a season to display
                the medal counts for Summer or Winter using radio buttons.
                Faceting by country ensures clarity when exploring multiple data
                points. Lastly, there is a tooltip on hovering over a bar to
                show the number of medals won by the country in the selected
                season for the corresponding year.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Critique:</strong> For some seasons in certain years,
                not all countries take part in the Games, so users might see
                fewer or more countries on choosing different years or seasons.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Line Chart Matrix</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark type used is a line (path) to
                represent a country over multiple years.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong> The horizontal position and order
                channel denotes years starting from 1896 to 2016, while the
                vertical position and order channel represents medal counts and
                these are both numerical attributes represented by
                magnitude-ordered channels. The color hue channel which is a
                identity channel for categorical attributes represents a country
                (NOC).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> The years are
                ordered from left to right in an increasing order enabling left
                to right reading and the medal counts are ordered from top to
                bottom in an increasing order enabling top to bottom reading.
                With the categorical-identity color hue channel, users can
                easily choose a country and follow its trend over multiple years
                as country is a nominal attribute. These channels are ranked
                highly in the list of magnitude and identity channels so we are
                following the principles of effectiveness and expressiveness.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> By default, the line chart shows
                the medal counts won by 5 countries in all years in certain
                sports. You can use the "Number of Countries" slider to choose
                the number of countries to display at any given time on all the
                charts (default value is 5). The sports shown are the top 12
                most popular ones in a season and they are column-faceted. With
                the "Select Sport" dropdown, you can either choose a specific
                sport to display on the entire map or select "All Sports" for
                the default view. You can select a season to display the medal
                counts for Summer or Winter using radio buttons. You can also
                click on a line in the chart to only show that country in all
                the line charts (other country lines are dimmed) and this
                selection is preserved when you switch between seasons. Clicking
                anywhere else in the chart will remove the highlighted country
                selection. Lastly, there is a tooltip on hovering over a line to
                show the number of medals won by a country in the selected
                season for the corresponding year for that sport.

                <strong>Critique:</strong> When the chart is showing all the
                countries in a season, it is hard to compare the performance of
                different countries in different sports because the lines cross
                each other multiple times over the years and there is a bit of
                cluttering for low values of medal counts. Due to this clutter,
                it can be difficult to click on an individual line to view its
                details and there can be frequent misclicks. It can also be
                difficult to get the exact medal count for a country without
                hovering over its line as the vertical axis is only for the
                charts on the left margin.

                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark type used is an interlocking
                area (poly) to represent the medal counts won by a country in a
                specific year.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong> The horizontal position and order
                channel denotes years starting from 1896 to 2016, while the
                vertical position and order channel represents medal counts and
                these are both numerical attributes represented by
                magnitude-ordered channels. The color hue channel which is a
                identity channel for categorical attributes represents a country
                (NOC).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> The years are
                ordered from left to right in an increasing order enabling left
                to right reading and the medal counts are ordered from top to
                bottom in an increasing order enabling top to bottom reading.
                With the categorical-identity color hue channel for the 2
                charts, it is easy to distinguish between which chart represents
                all countries and which one represents individual country
                trends. These channels are ranked highly in the list of
                magnitude and identity channels so we are following the
                principles of effectiveness and expressiveness.

                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> The first thing a user has to
                decide is which country they want to see the trends for. You can
                use the "Country" dropdown to choose a specific country to
                display. Once you have chosen a country, by default, the top
                chart shows the medal counts won by that country in all years in
                both seasons. The bottom chart (Total Medal Counts for All
                Countries) has a brush selection built in so rectangular regions
                that represent the time window you want to analyze can be
                selected and by moving this selection box around with the mouse,
                you can view updates only for that time window in the top chart.
                You can also click on a poly in the top chart to only show that
                country in the bottom chart (other country polys are dimmed) and
                this selection is preserved when you switch between seasons.
