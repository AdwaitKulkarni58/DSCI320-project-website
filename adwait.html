              The visualizations below explore the performance of countries in
              the Summer and Winter Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016. The data is
              visualized using heatmaps, faceted bar charts, line chart
              matrices, and area density charts to analyze individual national
              performance and dominance of countries in different events over
              time. The visualizations are interactive and allow users to
              explore the data by selecting specific countries, years, and
              seasons. Following are the research questions supported by the
              visualizations:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark type used is a point to
                represent each country's performance in a specific year in the
                heatmap (mark_rect). In the brush chart, the mark type used is a
                segment (mark_bar) to represent the medal counts won by a
                country in a specific year.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong> For the heatmap, the horizontal
                position and order channel denotes years starting from 1896 to
                2016, while the vertical position channel represents a country
                (NOC). The saturation channel represents the number of medals
                won by the country in each year and this is a magnitude ordered
                channel as the number of medals is a numerical attribute. Each
                cell in the heatmap has shared boundaries in terms of years and
                countries, horizontally and vertically respectively.<br />
                For the brush chart, the horizontal position and order channels
                represent the year and the vertical position and order channels
                represent the number of medals won by a country. The color hue
                channel represents the type of season (Summer or Winter).
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> In the heatmap,
                the sequential color scheme is used to encode magnitude of the
                number of medals won by a country in each year, helping users
                identify regions of high or low medal counts at a glance. The
                color scheme is appropriate as the number of medals is a
                numerical attribute and increases from a minimum to a maximum.
                The position channel for years helps the users read the graph
                from left to right with the years increasing from 1896 to 2016.
                The saturation channel and position channel are
                magnitude-ordered channels and adhere to the principle of
                expressiveness.
                <br />
                In the brush chart, the 2 color hues (orange and blue) on the
                opposite ends of the color hue channel help the users identify
                the Summer and Winter seasons clearly without getting mixed up.
                The years are ordered from left to right in an increasing order
                enabling left to right reading and the number of medals are
                ordered from top to bottom in an increasing order enabling top
                to bottom reading.
                <br />
                These channels are ranked highly in the list of magnitude and
                identity channels so we are following the principle of
                effectiveness.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> The heatmap is bidirectionally
                linked to the detailed brush chart in the same view and it is
                also bidirectionally linked to the faceted bar chart in a
                different view below it. Clicking on a cell in the heatmap will
                highlight the corresponding country in the heatmap and the
                corresponding country in the detailed brush chart view along
                with the corresponding country in the faceted bar chart.
                Similarly, clicking on a bar in the brush chart will highlight
                the corresponding country in the heatmap and the faceted bar
                chart. When you select a cell in the heatmap or a bar in the
                brush chart, everything else in both the charts will be
                unhighlighted, and clicking anywhere other than the highlighted
                parts will remove the highlight. This selection is preserved
                when you switch between seasons. Users can select a season to
                display the trends for Summer or Winter in both the charts using
                radio buttons. Users can also decide if they want to filter out
                countries based on how many medals they have won (low, medium,
                high) using a dropdown. The heatmap has a brush selection built
                in so rectangular regions can be selected and by moving this
                selection box around with clicking and dragging, you can view
                updates in the detailed brush chart. For both the heatmap and
                brush chart, there is a tooltip on hovering over a cell to show
                the number of medals won by the country in the selected season
                for the corresponding year.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Critique:</strong> There is a lot of information being
                displayed in the heatmap, so users may not be able to completely
                understand the data at a glance. The heatmap is useful for
                identifying groups or clsuters of similar performance, but users
                may also not be able to compare the performance of different
                countries in different seasons as the heatmap only shows the
                performance of a country in a specific season and you have to
                use the radio buttons to switch between seasons, so you might
                have to manually remember the trends of the previous season. Due
                to the sequential color scheme, users might not be able to
                identify the magnitude of the number of medals won by a country
                in each year without hovering over cells. In the brush chart, it
                is hard to select a country as multiple countries are stacked on
                top of each other in the same bar and can face difficulty in
                distinguishing between similarly colored cells. There is a lot
                of interactivity in the charts (tridirectional links), so users
                might get overwhelmed with the number of options to choose from
                and might not know where to start exploring the data.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark type used is a segment
                (mark_bar) to represent the medal counts won by a country in a
                specific year.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong> The horizontal position and order
                channel denotes medal counts starting from the minimum to the
                maximum, while the vertical position channel represents a
                country (NOC). The 1D length of the bars represents the number
                of medals won by the country in a specific year. The bar chart
                has been faceted by country so that each country has its own bar
                and each bar is aligned to the bottom of the chart for
                comparison with a common scale.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> The position
                channel on a common scale follows Weber's Law which states that
                human beings are more likely to compare objects on a common
                scale than on unaligned scales. It is easy to compare between 2
                countries because the length of the bars is proportional to the
                number of medals won by a country in a specific year. The
                vertical position channel on a common scale is also easy to
                compare between 2 countries because the bars are aligned to the
                bottom of the chart. The 1D length of the bars is a magnitude
                ordered channel and adheres to the principle of expressiveness.
                The medal counts are encoded on the horizontal position channel
                as a magnitude ordered channel and adheres to the principle of
                expressiveness. All these channels are ranked highly in the list
                of magnitude channels so we are following the principle of
                effectiveness.

              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> This view is bidirectionally
                linked to the heatmap view and brush chart view. Clicking on any
                country in the chart will also show the country trends in the
                heatmap and brush charts. There is a year dropdown menu to
                select a specific year to display the medal counts won by all
                country in that year and when you select a year, the heatmap
                will display that year with a vertical red line. You can also
                select a season to display the medal counts for Summer or Winter
                using radio buttons. Faceting by country ensures clarity when
                exploring multiple data points. Lastly, there is a tooltip on
                hovering over a bar to show the number of medals won by the
                country in the selected season for the corresponding year.

                <strong>Critique:</strong> For some seasons in certain years,
                not all countries take part in the Games, so users might see
                fewer or more countries on choosing different years or seasons.
                The dropdown menu for selecting a specific year can be long to
                scroll through and can get overwhelming pretty quickly if you
                are not familiar with the data. Not all countries can be shown
                in the chart due to information density issues, so users have to
                settle for a smaller number of countries (top performing ones).

            <h3>Line Chart Matrix</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark type used is a line (mark_line)
                to represent a country over multiple years.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong> The horizontal position and order
                channel denotes years starting from 1896 to 2016, while the
                vertical position and order channel represents medal counts and
                these are both numerical attributes represented by
                magnitude-ordered channels. The color hue channel which is a
                identity channel for categorical attributes represents a country
                (NOC).
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> The years are
                ordered from left to right in an increasing order enabling left
                to right reading and the medal counts are ordered from top to
                bottom in an increasing order enabling top to bottom reading.
                With the categorical-identity color hue channel, users can
                easily choose a country and follow its trend over multiple years
                as country is a nominal attribute. These channels are ranked
                highly in the list of magnitude and identity channels so we are
                following the principles of effectiveness and expressiveness.
                The line chart matrix is column-faceted by sports so that users
                don't have to scroll through a long list of sports to find the
                one they are interested in and these faceted charts share a
                common axis for effective comparison.

              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> By default, the line chart shows
                the medal counts won by 5 countries in all years in certain
                sports. You can use the "Number of Countries" slider to choose
                the number of countries to display at any given time on all the
                charts (default value is 5). The sports shown are the top 12
                most popular ones in a season and they are column-faceted. With
                the "Select Sport" dropdown, you can either choose a specific
                sport to display on the entire map or select "All Sports" for
                the default view. You can select a season to display the medal
                counts for Summer or Winter using radio buttons. You can also
                click on a line in the chart to only show that country in all
                the line charts (other country lines are dimmed) and this
                selection is preserved when you switch between seasons. Clicking
                anywhere else in the chart will remove the highlighted country
                selection. Lastly, there is a tooltip on hovering over a line to
                show the number of medals won by a country in the selected
                season for the corresponding year for that sport.

                <strong>Critique:</strong> When the chart is showing all the
                countries in a season, it is hard to compare the performance of
                different countries in different sports because the lines cross
                each other multiple times over the years and there is a bit of
                cluttering for low values of medal counts. Due to this clutter,
                it can be difficult to click on an individual line to view its
                details and there can be frequent misclicks. It can also be
                difficult to get the exact medal count for a country without
                hovering over its line as the vertical axis is only for the
                charts on the left margin.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark type used is an interlocking
                area (mark_area) to represent the medal counts won by a country
                in a specific year. The bottom chart uses a mark type of point
                to represent an individual country.
              </li>

                these are both numerical attributes represented by
                magnitude-ordered channels. The color hue channel which is a

                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> The years are

                to right reading and the medal counts are ordered from top to
                bottom in an increasing order enabling top to bottom reading.
                With the categorical-identity color hue channel for the 2
                charts, it is easy to distinguish between which chart represents
                all countries and which one represents individual country
                trends. These channels are ranked highly in the list of
                magnitude and identity channels so we are following the
                principles of effectiveness and expressiveness.

                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> The first thing a user has to
                decide is which country they want to see the trends for. You can
                use the "Country" dropdown to choose a specific country to
                display. Once you have chosen a country, by default, the top
                chart shows the medal counts won by that country in all years in
                both seasons. The bottom chart (Total Medal Counts for Top 50
                Countries) has a brush selection built in so rectangular regions
                that represent the time window you want to analyze can be
                selected and by moving this selection box around with the mouse,
                you can view updates only for that time window in the top chart.
                Whenever you select a country in the dropdown, the bottom chart
                will show the medal counts for that country in all years using
                red points, so you can compare the trend of that country in
                comparison to the total medals won by the top 50 countries.
                Lastly, both charts have tooltips that have information about
                the number of medals won by a country in a specific year.

                <strong>Critique:</strong> The country selection dropdown has 50
                options so it can be a bit long to scroll through and can get
                overwhelming pretty quickly if you are not familiar with NOC
                codes. The area density chart is useful to identify general
                patterns in the data, but it can be hard to identify small and
                subtle differences in medal counts between years.
