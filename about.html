              Welcome to our project exploring the rich history of the Olympic
              Games! Over the course of 120 years, the Olympic Games have
              showcased extraordinary human achievement, cultural milestones,
              and global sports history. Our project delves into this treasure
              box using the
              <a

              dataset, a compilation of athlete records, medal
              achievements, and event details spanning from Athens 1896 to Rio
              2016. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes over 271,000
              entries and offers insights into athlete demographics, event
              performances, and evolving trends across both the Summer and
              Winter Games. Our project is not just about numbers or medals;
              its a window into stories of perseverance, triumph, and change
              over time. We aim to answer intriguing questions like: Do certain
              countries excel in specific events? How have athlete demographics
              evolved? Which sports have gained popularity, and which have
              faded? Using data visualizations created with Altair, we provide
              clear and engaging insights into these questions, making this
              project accessible to sports enthusiasts, history buffs, and
              casual fans alike. Whether you are looking to explore patterns in
              medal wins, track the rise and fall of specific sports, or simply
              take a nostalgic journey through Olympic history, our project
              offers a fresh perspective. The analysis not only reveals past
              trends but also lays a foundation for predicting future
              participation and performance. So, join us as we celebrate the
              remarkable history of the Olympic Games, one visualization at a
              time!

                We have divided our analysis into four main research areas to better understand the dataset and the Olympics. For each area, we aim to answer different research questions and create different visualizations. These areas are:

              We are a group of four individuals with a shared passion for the
              Olympics, united by our diverse academic backgrounds in Computer
              Science, Economics, Earth and Ocean Sciences, and Statistics. Even though we have different backgrounds, we have a common love for sports and in particular the Olympics.
              Though our expertise varies—from technical algorithms to
              socio-economic interpretations, geographic connections to
              environmental factors, and statistical analyses—we share a common
              goal: to visually interpret and bring to life the history of the
              Olympic Games.
