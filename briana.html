              The visualizations below explore the performance of athletes based
              on their demographic information in the Summer and Winter Olympic
              Games from 1896 to 2016. The data is visualized using heatmaps,
              faceted bar charts, scatter plots, and area density charts to
              analyze the performance of male and female athletes of varying
              heights, weights, and ages in different events over time. The
              visualizations are interactive and allow users to explore the data
              by selecting specific countries, sports, and seasons. Following
              are the research questions supported by the visualizations:

              The first view allows users to view sports with different peak
              heights and weight (height and weights at which athletes win the
              most medals relative to the number of athletes participating) for
              all sports in the scatterplot, colored by the type of medal won in
              each sport. The distribution plots show a few specific sports that
              might be interesting to look at in terms of height and weight.
              When a type of medal is selected from the legend, the distribution
              of this type is emphasised and only the points for that medal type
              are shown in the scatter plot
            </p>

              The second view consists of a faceted histogram and a faceted line
              plot over time, both faceted by sex. The histogram presents the
              distribution and performance of male and female athletes of
              varying ages per sport selected, while the line plot demonstrates
              how the success of the age groups have changed over time

              This third view is a heatmap that displays the difference in
              performance by female and male athletes in the same sport over
              time, given the user has selected a specific country and season
              for which to view this data. It aims to help the user identify in
              which countries and for those countries in which sports there is a
              large, consistent discrepancy between the number of medals won by
              the female versus male athletes.
