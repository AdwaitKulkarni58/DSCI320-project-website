              The visualizations below explore the performance of athletes based
              on their demographic information in the Summer and Winter Olympic
              Games from 1896 to 2016. The data is visualized using heatmaps,
              faceted bar charts, scatter plots, and area density charts to
              analyze the performance of male and female athletes of varying
              heights, weights, and ages in different events over time. The
              visualizations are interactive and allow users to explore the data
              by selecting specific countries, sports, and seasons. Following
              are the research questions supported by the visualizations:

              The first view allows users to view sports with different peak
              heights and weight (height and weights at which athletes win the
              most medals relative to the number of athletes participating) for
              all sports in the scatterplot, colored by the type of medal won in
              each sport. The distribution plots show a few specific sports that
              might be interesting to look at in terms of height and weight.
              When a type of medal is selected from the legend, the distribution
              of this type is emphasised and only the points for that medal type
              are shown in the scatter plot

              The second view consists of a faceted histogram and a faceted line
              plot over time, both faceted by sex. The histogram presents the
              distribution and performance of male and female athletes of
              varying ages per sport selected, while the line plot demonstrates
              how the success of the age groups have changed over time

              performance by female and male athletes in the same sport over
              time, given the user has selected a specific country and season
              for which to view this data. It aims to help the user identify in
              which countries and for those countries in which sports there is a

              the female versus male athletes.

              <h2>Visualization Design Justification</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Linked Scatterplot and Density Plot</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark for the scatterplot being used
                is mark_circle() as it allows the plot to point out a specific
                combination of peak height and peak weight, for different
                sports. This results in each sport on the scatter plot having
                three points to represent it: one for each type of medal. For
                the density chart the area mark was used as we are attempting to
                represent the number of athletes over the height and weight
                ranges of athletes in each sport without using bins.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong> In the scatter plot the horizontal
                x-channel is being used to indicate the peak heights, while the
                vertical y-channel is being used to indicate the peak weights of
                athletes. The density plot is faceted vertically by sport, and
                horizontally by sex, and the two density plots for weight and
                height have been horizontally concatenated to one another. The
                horizontal x-encoding depicts weight or height, depending on
                which chart, and all the plots for weight/height for the
                different sports use a common x-axis which makes the
                distributions easier to compare between sexes and sports. The
                vertical y-encoding is used to show the density of the different
                medal groups over the height and weight ranges.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> The color in this
                view is encoding the type of medal won (Gold, Silver, Bronze, No
                Medal). This color scheme is kept uniform across the two plots
                so they are easy to compare, so the orange points on the scatter
                plot correspond to the orange distributions on the distribution
                chart, and they both represent athletes who won Gold medals.
                Tooltips are used in the scatterplot to denote which sport each
                point represents while in the density plot tooltips show the
                type of medal won as well as the height or weight on the x-axis
                that the location of the cursor corresponds to. This way it is
                easier to accurately identify the peak height and weight per
                gender of the different sports plotted.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> Opacity was used for
                interactivity encoding, which allows the user to select and view
                only one of the medal types. For example, one can select gold
                medals in the legend, and the distributions of athletes who have
                won gold medals will be emphasised by the reduction of opacity
                for the non-selected medal types. Upon legend selection, the
                scatter plot only shows the points belonging to that medal type
                for each sport (so now each sport will only have one point in
                the scatterplot), which we have encoded by using a transform
                filter on the selection.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Critique:</strong> This view successfully allows us to
                answer the research question because it lets us visualize the
                heights and weights at which athletes perform best for all
                sports, while also providing us more detailed information of the
                distributions of athletes’ heights and weights for some
                pre-selected sports. However, the drawback of this view is that
                it doesn’t allow us to visualize the more detailed distribution
                plots for any sport - only for the ones displayed there. An
                improvement on the plot would be to allow a brush selection on
                the scatterplot, which would be linked to the distribution plots
                so that they only show the top 5 sports in the brush-selected
                sports in the scatterplot.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Faceted Histogram and Line Plot</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark being used in the histogram is
                mark_bar() as this allows for effective comparison of the length
                of bars to determine the difference in counts of records. In the
                line graph the mark being used is mark_line() although we have
                specified point=True so that the ‘resolution’ of the data is
                also shown. The line mark was used for this part of the chart
                because it shows connections between points, which are
                intuitively connecting the points in the user's mind, making it
                clear they belong to the same age group. This makes the graph
                more easily interpretable.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong> In the histogram the horizontal axis
                is being used to represent age groups (binned every 2 years),
                while the vertical axis represents the count of athletes in each
                age group, as is customary for a histogram. The histograms are
                faceted by sex, in order to allow for comparison between female
                and male athletes, as is pertinent to the research question.
                This faceting highlights the similarities and differences
                between both the distribution of ages of athletes per gender and
                their success in the sport selected. The horizontal channel of
                the line graph is the year, while the y-axis shows the ratio of
                medals to no medals. Although the line graph is also faceted by
                sex, they still use the same x-axis, as is true for the
                histogram. The line graph allows the user to determine which age
                groups have had the most success over time.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> In the histogram
                color is used to depict the success of athletes in different age
                groups. The success was calculated by computing the ratio of
                medals (of all types) won to null medals per sport, per age
                group. Originally a continuous color scale was used, stretching
                from light green to dark blue, which resulted in all the colors
                above a ratio 1 looking like the same shade of dark blue, and
                many of the frequent ratios near zero all appeared as the same
                light green shade. Therefore a manual color scale was created,
                wherein color changes happen fast at small ratios close to zero,
                and then they happen slower at higher ratios because there are
                fewer higher ratios. I also specified that above 1 the color
                scale should change to another color, as 1 is sort of a
                neutral/central point to the data where the number of athletes
                who won medals in a specific age group of a sport is equal to
                the number of athletes who did not win medals. This color
                encoding makes the plot more effective because it allows the
                user to see the data at ‘high resolution’ of color. The user
                also knows that if they see purple there are more athletes who
                have won medals in a group than athletes who have not won
                medals, making that age group more ‘successful’. In general the
                more blue the color the higher the ratio of athletes who have
                won medals to those who have not won, although still below 1.
                The color encoding was not kept the same for the line graph; the
                colors are representing age groups instead of the medal ratio
                and therefore it would be misleading to have a similar/the same
                color encoding. Additionally, a categorical color scheme was
                used for the age groups as we are treating them as a categorical
                variable because our intention with this plot is to investigate
                the success of specific age groups over time.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> Initially the user must select a
                sport that they would like to view the athlete’s age information
                for via the dropdown widget. This plot also employs
                bi-directional linking between the bars in the histogram and the
                lines on the line graph. When a range of age groups is selected
                on the histogram using the brush, only those age groups are
                plotted on the line charts. This was executed in code via a
                transform filter using the brush on the line plot. Conversely,
                if the user clicks on one of the lines presented in the line
                graph, this line is made more opaque compared to the other
                lines, and it also makes the selected age group appear more
                opaque than the non-selected groups in the histogram.

                <strong>Critique:</strong> This visualization is effective for
                finding the top performing ages of male and female athletes for
                different sports because it displays information expressively
                and it reduces the amount of time needed to be spent figuring
                out the visualization by being intuitive to the user. A bar
                chart is a widely recognized graph, understood by most people so
                it takes little time to fathom the information it is displaying.
                Additionally, faceting the graphs vertically to display the male
                and female statistics separately allows for effective comparison
                between the sexes against a common axis. The use of the ratio
                successfully encodes the medal data as one variable represented
                by color, which is easy for users to process. The use of
                interactivity in this graph makes it particularly intuitive
                because it connects the charts within the view to one another.
                The line graph on the right is thus clearly linked to the
                information on the left while also providing more detailed
                information about the plot on the left. This plot allows us to
                go beyond simply answering the research question by adding the
                element of time.

              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> Since this is a heatmap, the mark used is
                mark_rect() as this allows us to keep the areas the same, thus
                not encoding any information within area, but allowing us to
                change the color of each rectangle to depict the difference
                between medals won by female and male athletes, normalized by
                the sum of medals won by all athletes in that sport. This way we
                can show this difference per sport and as it changes over time,
                as the research question demands.

                <strong>Channels:</strong> The x-axis on this chart shows the
                year in which the olympics took place, while the y-axis reflects
                the sport the athletes competed in. This is most effective
                because it allows us to see all the sports at once, over time,
                with information about medals won and sex of athletes who won
                the medals - so there’s a lot of data being displayed. Therefore
                the user can determine in which sports the female or male team
                of a country have been dominating, and for which sports the
                success of both genders is roughly the same. The dropdowns allow
                the user to choose only one country to view, and also the option
                to choose which season (winter or summer) they would like to
                view the sports for. We have provided the option to select the
                season as it allows users who know roughly which data they want
                to see to visualize less data at a time which makes it less
                overwhelming and easier to process.

                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> The color encoding
                is being used to show the difference in medals won by female
                athletes minus male athletes, normalized by the total number of
                medals won in that sport in that year in the selected country.
                Since the color scale is depicting a difference there is a clear
                central point to the data where the difference is zero and the
                number of medals won by both genders is equal. Consequently we
                have employed a diverging color scale where the color is gray at
                zero. Gray at zero was chosen because there are years and sports
                for each country where none of their athletes (female or male)
                won a medal, so there is ‘no data’ for that rectangle on the
                graph, which appears white. Thus the nan values are
                differentiated from the points/rectangles where the number of
                medals won by men and women was the same. This color encoding,
                along with how we have placed the channels, is successful
                because it allows users to easily identify rows (which are
                sports) where the color is a dark hue over a longer horizontal
                range, answering our research question. Since the heatmap’s
                color itself doesn’t show any information about the total number
                of medals won by that country (since we have normalized by
                this), and it might be useful to know, we have included this
                information in the tooltip.

                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> The interactivity of this map is
                mainly in the dropdown menu which allows the user to select
                which country for which they would like to view the data, as
                well as which season of sports they would like to see. This
                makes the graph accessible to people who are just wanting to
                explore the data without a real purpose, as well as those who
                want to investigate the details of a season, for example.

                <strong>Critique:</strong> This map is highly effective for
                answering the research question as it allows us to see all the
                sports at once, and we can evaluate the ‘consistency’ of male or
                female dominance in a sport due to the time component.
                Additionally, the color encoding is extremely effective because
                it allows users to easily visually pick out rows where there is
                a long horizontal line where the color is staying a consistently
                dark due. This chart’s pitfall, however, is that the user is
                unable to compare between countries as the country must be
                selected beforehand. We also cannot infer much information about
                the performance of the country overall in each sport as we
                cannot simply assume each white rectangle is where they haven’t
                won any medals because we have no assurance that they even
                participated in that year. This information, however, is not
                required by our research question.
