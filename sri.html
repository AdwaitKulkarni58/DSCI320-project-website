              The visualizations below explore Olympic team performance across
              different host cities and seasons from 1896 to 2016. The data is
              visualized using pie charts, bar charts, line charts, heat maps,
              and scatter plots. This dashboard explores patterns in medal
              distribution, host city advantages, and sport-specific
              contributions to overall success. These visualizations allow users
              to filter by host city, season (Summer vs. Winter), and sport to
              examine trends and disparities in medal counts. Following are the
              research questions supported by the visualizations:

              The first view is a 3 chart dashboard comprising two pie charts
              and a bar chart. The first pie chart displays the Host Team based
              on Host City. The bar chart shows the top N (usually 20 but some
              sports have less than 20 teams competing) teams for a given sport.
              We can then click on the bars to see a breakdown of medal
              distribution for the selected Team. We can then compare
              distribution and medal counts between the Host Team and other
              Non-Host Teams and if they rank in the top N teams for that sport.

              interactive bar charts, heatmaps, and pie charts that dynamically
              adapt based on user selections:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Analyze Host Team Performance:</strong> To determine

            <h3>Pie Chart and Linked Bar Chart</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The pie chart uses mark_arc() to
                represent the Host Team's medal distribution (Gold, Silver,
                Bronze). The bar chart uses mark_bar() to show the total number
                of medals won by each of the top teams in a given sport.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong>
                <br />
                Pie chart:
                <br />
                Color hue is used to differentiate medal types (Gold, Silver,
                Bronze).
                <br />
                We use area to encode the proportion of each medal type
                representing their relative share of the total.
                <br />
                Text in the center conveys the total medal count, providing a
                medal count summary.
                <br />
                <br />
                Bar chart:
                <br />
                Height of each bar encodes the total number of medals won per
                team, which is a magnitude channel.
                <br />
                Position along the horizontal axis shows different teams,
                ordered by medal count.
                <br />
                Color hue identifies a host team and links to the legend on the
                right (categorical encoding), bars are greyed-out before being
                clicked on.
                <br />
                Tooltip shows more details when you hover over the data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> In both pie
                charts, colour hue is used categorically to represent medal
                types which are easily distinguishable. The use of area to
                encode proportion is visually intuitive for users. The total
                medal count is reinforced with a label at the center of each pie
                chart. The middle bar chart uses bar length as an effective
                quantitative channel for medal count, making it easy to compare
                performance across teams. Teams are ordered by medal count,
                leveraging position to help with readability. The selected team
                is highlighted using a categorical colour scale indicated in the
                legend. This dual use of colour, both to indicate host team
                identity and to emphasize selection helps with expressivity. The
                alignment of the charts allows for an intuitive left-to-right
                comparison: host team on the left, global context in the middle,
                and selected team on the right.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> Users are able to select which
                Sport and City they’d like to explore. Based on this, we might
                see a pie chart that represents the cities Host Team (Sometimes
                unavailable). We are also able to click on the bar chart to see
                a detailed breakdown of medal distribution for a given Team in
                another pie chart which pops up beside it. The number of teams
                displayed on the bar chart will vary, based on how many teams
                competed in the given filter selection (Sometimes very sparse)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Critique:</strong> This dashboard effectively answers
                the research question due to its interactivity and side by side
                chart views. For a given city, we are always able to see the
                host team medal distribution for a given sport (if it exists).
                Beside this, we see the next N top performing counties which
                allows us to visually compare how the host team is fairing when
                compared to others. We even get to dive into more detail if we
                want to compare the host team with another team in particular
                since we get medal breakdowns for each. A downfall of this
                dashboard is the fact that some combinations of city and sport
                result in very sparse plots or empty plots for host team. This
                is not a bug but just how teams participate. A way to improve
                would be to dynamically adjust the sport dropdown to only show
                sports where we know a host team has participated based on city.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interval Selection Line Chart</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The line plot uses mark_line() to show
                the trends of host vs non-host teams over the years while the
                lower area chart uses mark_area().
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong>
                <br />
                Main Line Chart:
                <br />
                The X-position is used to encode Year.
                <br />
                The Y-position is used to encode Medal Count.
                <br />
                I use color hue as a way to identify Host vs Non-Host Teams.
                <br />
                I use line style (Dotted vs solid) to encode host status.
                <br />
                We also have a tooltip to show additional details such as year
                and medal count that might be hard to read.
                <br />
                <br />
                Area Chart (Year Range Selector):
                <br />
                The X-position is used to encode Year, same as above for
                brushing interaction.
                <br />
                The Y-position is used to encode Medal Count.
                <br />
                I use colour hue as a way to identify Host vs Non-Host Teams.
                <br />
                The area mark represents the cumulative medal count visually.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> This dual-view
                visualization uses position along the x-axis to represent time
                (year) and the y-axis to represent medal count, both of which
                are continuous and quantitative variables. Position is highly
                effective here as it enables users to detect trends and changes
                in medal counts over time with ease. Color hue is used to
                distinguish between Host Teams and Non-Host Teams. In the upper
                chart, line style (solid vs dotted) and point markers (circles)
                further differentiate the two categories, enhancing readability.
                In the area chart, the cumulative area under the curve provides
                an effective summary of overall medal volume across time. This
                area chart also serves as a time range selector, enhancing
                interactivity. The visual encoding choices are clear and
                perceptually effective and support both trend detection and
                categorical comparison while adhering to principles of
                expressiveness and effectiveness.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> Here we have an Interval
                selection line chart. We can brush across a year range on one of
                the lower charts and we get a zoomed in view of that selection
                in the upper charts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Critique:</strong> This is quite a simple chart and
                works together with the above chart to show general long term
                trends. The interval selection works really well here given the
                very large year range. One downfall is the redundant legend (I
                could not figure out how to drop this)
              </li>

            <h3>Heatmap</h3>
            <ul>

                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> This heatmap uses
                position on the x-axis to represent sports and medal types
                (Gold, Silver, Bronze) on the y-axis, both of which are
                categorical. The main encoding channel for medal count is colour
                saturation using a perceptually sequential colour scale that
                ranges from deep purple (low values) to bright yellow (high
                values) and neon green for values over 20 (outliers or rare high
                counts). This choice effectively conveys magnitude differences
                in medal contributions, letting users detect patterns such as
                performance in specific sports or a skew toward certain medal
                types. The grid structure with shared boundaries between cells
                helps in scanning rows and columns to identify patterns and
                clusters while the ordered layout supports intuitive reading
                from left to right (by sport) and top to bottom (by medal type).

                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> By default we have both seasons,
                all cities and teams shown. The user then has to decide the
                season, city and team they’d like to explore. The season
                selection is a radial button while city and team have a dropdown
                due to the many options available. All these selections filter
                the heatmap and will dynamically change. Some heatmaps may be
                sparse, once again, due to not all teams always participating.
                We also have a tooltip which provides additional information not
                available at first glance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Critique:</strong> This heatmap effectively answers the
                research question as it visually shows us any “hot spots” which
                would indicate a high medal count and thus show sports with the
                largest medal contribution. As with the first view, some
                combinations result in a blank heatmap since the team might have
                not participated in the sport or season. A downfall that I found
                difficult to navigate is the colour. We have a lot of sports
                where medal counts were 1 while some had 60. This created a big
                range leaving most of the heatmap one shade making it hard to
                distinguish boundaries. To combat this, I have manually limited
                the medal count in the scale so granular differences are more
                pronounced.

                city and how many cities had the same number of teams win
                medals.

                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> For this view, the
                scatter plot uses position along the x- and y-axes to represent
                quantitative variables, the number of teams that won medals and
                the average number of medals per team. Position is one of the
                most effective visual channels for interpreting numerical data,
                allowing users to quickly compare values across host cities. The
                categorical colour hue channel is used to distinguish between
                host cities, enabling consistent identification of each city
                across both charts. For the bar chart, bar height encodes the
                count of host cities that fall into each binned range, which is
                another highly effective channel for magnitude comparisons.
                Although the x-axis in the bar chart uses binned intervals, this
                grouping helps simplify distribution patterns without
                overwhelming the user with granularities.

                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> Here we have a bi-directionally
                linked view. We are able to click on a city on the scatter plot
                which displays just that city on the bar chart or brush over
                points to see multiple cities on the bar chart. We can also
                click on cities on the bar chart to locate them on the
                scatterplot. This makes it easy to compare with other cities. We
                also have the option to vary the number of cities we want to
                see. This ranges from 1 to 30.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Critique:</strong> I think this viz answers the question
                really well due to the juxtaposition of the two plots. The
                scatterplot is great since it visually shows the distribution
                which helps us easily identify outliers or clusters that might
                interest us. The bar chart further gives us a simpler way to see
                the number of cities that have x amount of teams win medals. The
                brushing is useful as we get to explore data points of interest.
                I have also chosen a custom colour palette here to accommodate
                the 30 unique teams which clearly distinguishes each team.
