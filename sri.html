              The visualizations below explore Olympic team performance across
              different host cities and seasons from 1896 to 2016. The data is
              visualized using pie charts, bar charts, line charts, heat maps,
              and scatter plots. This dashboard explores patterns in medal
              distribution, host city advantages, and sport-specific
              contributions to overall success. These visualizations allow users
              to filter by host city, season (Summer vs. Winter), and sport to
              examine trends and disparities in medal counts. Following are the
              research questions supported by the visualizations:

              The first view is a 3 chart dashboard comprising two pie charts
              and a bar chart. The first pie chart displays the Host Team based
              on Host City. The bar chart shows the top n (usually 20 but some
              sports have less than 20 teams competing) teams for a given sport.
              We can then click on the bars to see a breakdown of medal
              distribution for the selected Team. We can then compare
              distribution and medal counts between the Host Team and other
              Non-Host Teams and if they rank in the top n teams for that sport.

              The second view is an Interval Selection for a date range. We can

              The third view is Heatmap with Season, Sport and Host City
              filters. This shows which sports contribute the most to a Teams
              overall medal count for any given city. This is useful to find
              outliers or identify which sports some Teams are strong/weak in
              and compare performance in different cities.

              The fourth view is a bi-directionally linked dashboard of a

              they want to see (1-30). Users can also brush over the scatterplot
              or click on a city to see a detailed view of the number of teams
              that won medals and how many other cities had the same number of
              teams win and vice versa with the bar chart. We also have a custom
              colour scheme to have unique colours for each Team.

              The visualizations above support the following tasks by employing
              interactive scatterplots with linked detail brush charts,
              interactive bar charts, heatmaps, and pie charts that dynamically
              adapt based on user selections:

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Analyze Host Team Performance:</strong> To determine
                whether host teams experience a medal boost in their home cities
                compared to non-host teams, and how this varies between the
                Summer and Winter Olympics.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Explore Medal Distribution by Sport:</strong> To
                identify which sports contribute most to a teamâ€™s overall medal
                count, and analyze how this varies across different host cities
                and Olympic seasons.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Understand City-Specific Patterns:</strong> To analyse
                whether certain host cities exhibit unique trends in medal
                distribution or concentration of success.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Explore Host vs. Non-Host Trends Over Time:</strong> To
                select a custom date range and compare the long-term trends in
                medal performance between Host and Non-Host teams.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Drill Down by City, Team, or Sport:</strong> To
                interactively select and explore specific teams, cities, or
                sports, revealing granular patterns in medal counts,
                distribution, and performance using linked charts and filters.
