              The visualizations below explore the participation and performance
              of countries and athletes in Sports and Events in the Olympic
              Games from 1896 to 2016. Using interactive bar charts,
              bidirectionally linked line charts, and density-bar chart
              combinations, the data is analyzed to understand trends in
              participation by country, athlete demographics by gender over
              time, and the age distribution of medalists. The visualizations
              are interactive, allowing users to select specific sports, filter
              by gender, track country participation over time, and compare
              athlete demographics across sports.

              These bidirectionally linked line charts show the participation
              trends in the top 5 sports by NOC and their associated top 3
              events. The user can select the sport using the drop-down below
              and analyse the trends in both the plots. They are vertically
              connected, making a view that allows easy comparison. Also, the
              bidirectional linking allows users to explore connections between
              sports and their events, ensuring deeper insights into
              participation changes.

              top 10 sports across the years, allowing users to see if gender
              representation has become more balanced. By using bars and colour
              encoding for gender, it highlights sports with increasing or

              The density plot reveals the distribution of medalists' ages,
              helping a user analyse whether a certain sport has younger or
              older athletes winning medals. Users can select any one of the top
              10 sports using the drop-down option. The bar chart horizontally
              added to this view shows the total medal counts per age group
              (binned), making it easy to figure out which age groups dominate
              in different events. Lately, the interactive legend allows users

              The visualizations above support the following tasks by utilizing
              interactive bar charts, bidirectionally linked line charts, and
              density-bar chart combinations, allowing users to dynamically
              explore sports participation by country, athlete demographics by
              gender over time, and age distribution for medal winners:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Analyze Participation Trends:</strong> Identifying how
                athlete participation in different sports has evolved over time,
                with a focus on gender distribution and changes in
                representation.

            <h3>Bidirectionally Linked Line Charts</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark type used is a line (path) to
                represent the number of participating countries in different
                sports/events over time in both the line charts linked together
                by bidirectional linking.
                <br />
                The Line mark indicates how the relationship evolves over time,
                showing increases, decreases, or reversals.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong> Horizontal Position & Order:
                Represents years in an increasing sequence.
                <br />
                Vertical Position: Represents the number of participating
                countries in a sport/event.
                <br />
                Color Hue: Color Hue: Represents different sports/events,
                distinguishing participation trends.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> Different colors
                of the lines ensure the differentiation and easy following of
                the lines.
                <br />
                The ordering of years follows a natural chronological sequence,
                helping in comprehension.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> Using the dropdown selection,
                users can select a specific sport, which inadvertently affects
                the events plot too, displaying the top 3 events associated with
                that sport.
                <br />
                Hovering over the event plot displays its title, year, and NOC
                count.
                <br />
                Bidirectional linking connects the trends of sports and their
                corresponding top 3 events, allowing users to see how
                participation has evolved. It allows users to highlight a time
                range and view corresponding trends in both graphs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Critique:</strong> Some sports/events may have small
                fluctuations, making it difficult to see trends without zooming
                in.
                <br />
                A normalization option (e.g., showing percentage growth instead
                of raw numbers) could make comparisons clearer.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Bar Chart with Interactive Legend and Dropdown</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark type used are bars representing
                the number of participants in the top 10 sports over the years,
                with separate colours for male (light blue) and female (pink)
                participants.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong> Horizontal Position & Order:
                Represents the years from the start of the Olympics to the
                present (1986-2016).
                <br />
                Vertical Position & Order: Represents the number of participants
                (count) in a given sport.
                <br />
                Color Hue: Represents gender (male or female) with distinct
                colours light blue and pink.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> The left-to-right
                order of years follows a naturally ordered reading flow, making
                trends easy to follow.
                <br />
                The vertical axis uses an ordered scale, allowing for a
                straightforward comparison of participation trends through the
                height of the bars.
                <br />
                The colour hue channel ensures that male and female
                participation trends are visually distinct. Stacked or grouped
                bars allow direct comparisons within the same sport.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> A drop-down menu allows users to
                filter participation trends by sport. It allows users to select
                and view trends in any of the 10 sports.
                <br />
                Hovering over a bar displays a tooltip showing the exact sport,
                sex, count of IDs, and year through the use of a tooltip.
                <br />
                An interactive legend allows users to view the bars only for
                male or female athletes by clicking on the legend. This allows
                for a more clearer understanding of trends by gender.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Critique:</strong> Stacked bars can make it difficult to
                compare male and female participation directly since both bars
                don’t share a common baseline. But the interactive legend helps
                with this, allowing to single view per gender.
                <br />
                Some sports have fluctuating participation, making trends
                difficult to interpret at a glance.
                <br />
                If bars are too close together, it may be difficult to
                distinguish year-by-year trends.
                <br />
                The colour choices for gender should be distinct enough to
                prevent confusion, especially in grayscale or
                colorblind-friendly modes.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Density Plot & Bar Chart (Age Distribution of Medalists)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark:</strong> The mark type used is a Density plot to
                represent the distribution of ages among medalists. A bar chart
                is overlaid to show the total counts of medalists in different
                age groups.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Channels:</strong> Horizontal Position & Order (Density
                Plot & Bar Chart): Represents the age of athletes.
                <br />
                Vertical Position (Density Plot): Represents the density of
                medalists of different ages.
                <br />
                Vertical Position (Bar Chart): This represents the total count
                of medalists in each age bin.
                <br />
                Colour Hue: Represents medal type (None, Gold, Silver, Bronze).
                The None type represents athletes who didn't win anything.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Characteristics of Channels:</strong> The Density plot
                allows for visualizing distributions, making it easier to see
                where the majority (most density) of medalists fall in terms of
                age.
                <br />
                The bar chart provides a quick overview of age bins, giving an
                easier way to compare total counts.
                <br />
                Colour hue ensures medal-type differentiation, allowing users to
                analyze which age groups dominate gold, silver, bronze or
                non-winners (None).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interactivity:</strong> The dropdown selection allows
                users to filter by sport, helping focus on a specific sport at
                once.
                <br />
                Hovering over the Density plot reveals tooltips with precise
                information about age distributions and density. In the case of
                the bar chart it gives precise age and count of records.
                <br />
                Clicking on a medal type in the legend filters the
                visualization, dimming the other medals to highlight trends for
                a single category. This allows users to view the trends for a
                single medal type at once.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Critique:</strong> The Density plot might be difficult
                to interpret for users unfamiliar with density estimation and
                just in general it is not easily interpretable at first glance.
                <br />
                Outliers (very young or old medalists) might distort the
                visualization if not handled properly.
